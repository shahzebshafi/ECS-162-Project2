            <h2>About the Game Arcade</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Game Arcade!. This website consists of three games: Coin Toss Simulator, 
                Rock, Paper, Scissors and Snake. The coin toss simulator and the rock, paper, scissors game
                were created by me, and the snake game is based off an open source game with an MIT license created by Rabi Roshan.
                I slightly modified the open source game to fit the theme of the website, and added a new feature of ending the game when the snake runs into a wall,
                instead of only ending when it runs into itself.
                The purpose of this website is to learn more about HTML and CSS, and to use javascript
                for the first time to create interative games. I hope you enjoy using the website and playing
                these games. </p>
